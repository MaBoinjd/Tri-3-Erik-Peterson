## Quiz 3 MCQ 

#### Results: 43/50

#### Corrections:
Q7: My answer - A is incorrect because the procedure runs without an error and will return a value.
    Actual answer - D is correct because the procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j,
    or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j 
    exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

Q18: My answer - B is incorrect because the procedure traverses this list and never encounters a positive value. The procedure then returns false as intended.
     Actual answer - C is correct becauseThe procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when
     it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values.
     
Q22: My answer - D is incorrect because if the fraction 2/3 were to be represented as an integer, it would be rounded or truncated to an integer value.
     Actual answer - B is correct because the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating-point numbers) limits the range of floating-point values.
     
Q30: My answer - B is incorrect because the Internet is a network of interconnected networks, but the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the 
     Internet.
     Actual answer - D is correct because the Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The 
     World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet.

Q34: My answer - C is incorrect because this algorithm has linear efficiency, so it runs in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, a heuristic is not appropriate.
     Actual answer - B is correct as this algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find
     an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time.
     
Q35: My answer - B is incorrect because geolocation data can be accessed by the Web site, which can use this information to provide album reviews from nearby users.
     Actual answer - D is correct because if the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA.

Q38: My answer - C is incorrect because publishing an e-book with a no-rights-reserved Creative Commons license enables people to freely distribute it.
     Actual answer - B is correct because a no-rights-reserved Creative Commons license is used when the creator of a published work wants the work to be made freely
     available to everyone.
